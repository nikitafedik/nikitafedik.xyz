Exciting news! Our article ***"Synergy of semiempirical models and machine learning in computational chemistry"*** has been featured on the front cover of the September issue of the Journal of Chemical Physics. Moreover, it is [open-acess](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-split/159/11/110901/2911476/Synergy-of-semiempirical-models-and-machine)! 

I am thrilled to see how ML enhances old-school quantum mechanics. Note the need for new flexible optimization tools and datasets was marked by James Stewart, Mr. Mopac, back in [2002](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0470845015.cpa014). Many of his conclusions could be easily taken for excerpts from modern ML papers. 

> The lesson learned from this experience, an important lesson painfully learned, was that the composition of the reference data set is of paramount importance.  

> Finally, as more and more elements are parameterized, and as methods become increasingly sophisticated, the transition will have to be made to a purely mathematical approach.
